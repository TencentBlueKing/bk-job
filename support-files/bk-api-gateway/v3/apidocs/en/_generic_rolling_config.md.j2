| max_execute_object_num_in_batch       | int  | no       | The maximum number of source hosts/containers per batch, not filled in indicates no limit       |

**Source File Rolling Strategy Description:**  
A source file group is treated as a unit. For each group, check if the number of target machines or files exceeds the
specified limits:  
If no limit is exceeded: Group as many adjacent source file groups as possible into a single rolling batch in
sequence.  
If any limit is exceeded: Split the source file group into multiple rolling batches based on the rolling parameters.  
Priority: When dividing batches, prioritize completing all batches for the same group of machines before moving to the
next group.

**Example 1 (Single Machine, Single File, Serial Batches):**  
Source File Configuration:  
Source File Group 1: Files [File1, File2] | Machines [Machine1, Machine2, Machine3]  
max_execute_object_num_in_batch = 1  
max_file_num_of_single_execute_object = 1  
Resulting Batches (6 batches):  
Batch 1: Machine1 x File1  
Batch 2: Machine1 x File2  
Batch 3: Machine2 x File1  
Batch 4: Machine2 x File2  
Batch 5: Machine3 x File1  
Batch 6: Machine3 x File2

**Example 2 (Splitting a Source File Group into Multiple Batches):**  
Source File Configuration:  
Source File Group 1: Files [File1, File2, File3] | Machines [Machine1, Machine2, Machine3]  
Source File Group 2: File [File4] | Machine [Machine4]  
max_execute_object_num_in_batch = 2  
max_file_num_of_single_execute_object = 2  
Resulting Batches (5 batches):  
Batch 1: Machines [Machine1, Machine2] x Files [File1, File2]  
Batch 2: Machines [Machine1, Machine2] x File [File3]  
Batch 3: Machine [Machine3] x Files [File1, File2]  
Batch 4: Machine [Machine3] x File [File3]  
Batch 5: Machine [Machine4] x File [File4]

**Example 3 (Large Rolling Parameters Merge Multiple Groups into One Batch):**  
Source File Configuration:  
Source File Group 1: Files [File1, File2, File3] | Machines [Machine1, Machine2, Machine3]  
Source File Group 2: File [File4] | Machine [Machine4]  
max_execute_object_num_in_batch = 4  
max_file_num_of_single_execute_object = 4  
Resulting Batch (1 batch):  
Batch 1:  
Machines [Machine1, Machine2, Machine3] x Files [File1, File2, File3] (parallel) Machine [Machine4] x File [File4]
