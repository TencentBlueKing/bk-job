job.analysis.ai.greetingMessage=Welcome to JOB! I'm your AI-assistant, is there anything  i can help you with ?
job.analysis.ai.emptyLogTaskAnswerMessage=Due to the absence of return logs from the execution results, I cannot accurately analyze the specific cause of the error and provide suggestions for resolution. However, it is known that when the JOB system shows "log returns empty, and the return code is non-zero", it is highly likely due to the execution logic of the script, as the JOB return code is derived from the execution result on the target machine. If the situation is "logs are empty, and the return code is also empty", it may be because the target machine does not have the GSE Agent installed. Please pay attention to the description information on the "group label" of the execution result. If the problem still cannot be resolved, you can contact [BK-Assistant]({BK_JOB_AI_TEMPLATE_VAR{bk_helper_link}}) for manual consultation and assistance.
